Conclusion

This Source-to-Target Mapping document, architecture diagram, and data flow description complete the logical design of the RMHC warehouse migration. The defined mappings ensure that legacy patient and clinical data are accurately transformed and ingested into a live FHIR environment. By separating concerns into infrastructure, governance (Rulebook), and translation layers, the architecture supports validation, semantic integrity, and transactional safety, demonstrating a robust and scalable approach to modern healthcare data warehousing.
